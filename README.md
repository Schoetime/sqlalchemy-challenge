# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this homework assignment, I completed some data analysis of temperature data in Hawaii over the past year. I graphed rainfall in inches over that time period as well as the most common temperatures at one of the weather stations.

I then attempted to recreate that analysis in a flask app. I started by copying the structural code from one of the student activities and changed the connection to the correct file. After that was all set up, I attempted to return JSON lists of each query. I was unable to complete the start date and start/end date range queries but will attempt to finish them when I have more time.
